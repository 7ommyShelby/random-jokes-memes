# Programming Memes and Chuck Norris Jokes Server

## Overview

This project involves creating an Express server that fetches programming memes and Chuck Norris jokes from different APIs using Axios. The server is designed to provide users with a fun and entertaining experience by serving them with a mix of humorous programming-related content.

## Features

### Express Server Setup

- The project utilizes the Express framework to create a server that listens on port 4000.

### API Integration

- The server makes asynchronous requests to two different APIs:
  - **Programming Memes API**: Fetches programming memes from the "programming-memes-images" API.
  - **Chuck Norris Jokes API**: Retrieves random Chuck Norris jokes from the "matchilling-chuck-norris-jokes" API.

### Error Handling

- The code includes error handling using try-catch blocks to manage potential errors during API requests.
- However, there is room for improvement in handling and responding to errors more effectively.

### Data Processing

- The server processes the API responses by extracting relevant information:
  - For programming memes, it extracts the image URLs.
  - For Chuck Norris jokes, it attempts to extract the joke content.
  - There is a need to verify the structure of the Chuck Norris API response for accurate data extraction.

### Response Generation

- The server constructs a JSON response for the /getjokes endpoint, combining the fetched programming memes' image URLs and Chuck Norris jokes.
- The response structure may need refinement to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance error handling to provide more informative and user-friendly error responses.
- Verify the structure of the Chuck Norris API response to ensure accurate data extraction.
- Refine the response structure for the /getjokes endpoint to improve clarity and consistency.
